As a beginner, building a task tracking web app in React is a great way to get started with this powerful library.

React is a popular choice for building web apps because it allows for the creation of dynamic, interactive user interfaces with ease. Its component-based architecture makes it easy to break down complex UI into smaller, reusable pieces. Additionally, React's virtual DOM allows for efficient rendering and updating of the UI, resulting in faster and smoother user experiences.

As a first project in React, building a task tracking web app will allow me to gain hands-on experience with fundamental React concepts such as components, state management, and lifecycle methods. I will also get to work with a variety of useful libraries and tools, such as React Router for navigation, Axios for making API requests, and Bootstrap for styling.

So, I am ready to dive into the world of React development and build a useful and practical app that will showcase my skills as a developer!

To launch the application, please navigate to the project directory and open two terminal windows, run 1st command in 1st terminal to start react development server and run second command to start json-server

> npm run start

> npm run server
